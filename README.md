- [univalence-funext](univalence-funext.v) - A simplified version of a [proof](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/BauerLumsdaineUnivalence.pdf) by Andrej Bauer and Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine that univalence implies extensional equality. This version highlights the central lemma, which states that equivalences are monomorphisms (in the categorical sense).
