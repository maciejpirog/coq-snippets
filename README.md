- [hottbook-ex4_7.v](hottbook-ex4_7) - A solution to Exercise 4.7 from the [HoTT book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/).

- [univalence-funext](univalence-funext.v) - A simplified version of a [proof](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/BauerLumsdaineUnivalence.pdf) by Andrej Bauer and Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine that univalence implies extensional equality (originally due to Voevodsky). This version highlights the central lemma, which states that equivalences are monomorphisms (in the categorical sense).
